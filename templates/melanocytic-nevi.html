                <p class="card-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melanocytic nevi, commonly referred to as moles, are benign skin growths that arise from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing pigment in the skin. These nevi typically appear as small, round, or oval-shaped spots on the skin and can vary in color, ranging from tan to dark brown. They can develop anywhere on the body, including the face, arms, legs, and torso. These nevi usually emerge during childhood or adolescence but can continue to develop or change throughout a person's life. While most melanocytic nevi are harmless, it's essential to monitor them for any changes in size, shape, or color, as these changes could indicate the development of melanoma, a potentially dangerous form of skin cancer.</p>

These nevi can appear anywhere on the body and are usually brown, black, or flesh-colored.

Monitoring changes in moles is important as atypical nevi can sometimes develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Regular skin checks and awareness of the characteristics of your moles can help in early detection of any suspicious changes.</p>
