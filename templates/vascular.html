                <p class="card-text">Vascular lesions are abnormal growths or formations of blood vessels in the skin or other tissues. These lesions can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life. Common types of vascular lesions include hemangiomas, port-wine stains, and cherry angiomas. They can vary in appearance, ranging from red or purple spots to raised lumps.<br>Most vascular lesions are benign and do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms, are located in problematic areas, or are of cosmetic concern. However, it's important to monitor any changes and seek medical advice if needed.</p>
