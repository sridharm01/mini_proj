                        <p class="card-text">Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer,
                            accounting for about 80% of all skin cancer cases. It typically develops in areas of the skin
                            that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, head, neck, and upper body. BCC
                            usually grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body, but it can cause
                            disfigurement if left untreated.</p>

                        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1. Appearance:</strong> Basal cell carcinoma often
                                appears as a pearly or waxy bump on the skin, or as a flat, flesh-colored or brown
                                scar-like lesion. It may also present as a red, irritated patch of skin or a sore that
                                does not heal.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. Causes:</strong> The primary cause of basal cell
                                carcinoma is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning
                                beds. People with fair skin, light-colored eyes, and a history of frequent sun exposure
                                are at higher risk of developing BCC.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Diagnosis:</strong> Basal cell carcinoma is usually
                                diagnosed through a visual examination by a dermatologist or healthcare provider. In
                                some cases, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the subtype
                                of BCC.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Treatment:</strong> Treatment options for basal cell
                                carcinoma depend on the size, location, and subtype of the tumor, as well as the
                                individual's overall health. Common treatments include surgical excision, Mohs
                                micrographic surgery, cryotherapy (freezing), laser therapy, and topical medications.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>5. Prognosis:</strong> Basal cell carcinoma is highly
                                treatable, especially when detected early. The prognosis for BCC is generally excellent,
                                with a low risk of recurrence or metastasis if the tumor is removed completely. Regular
                                follow-up examinations are important to monitor for any signs of recurrence or new skin
                                lesions.</li>

                                radiation by wearing protective clothing, such as wide-brimmed hats and long-sleeved
                                shirts, and using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF on exposed skin.</li>

                            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Regular Skin Examinations:</strong> Conduct monthly

                                annual skin checks with a dermatologist for a comprehensive evaluation.</li>

                <p class="card-text">Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer. It arises from the basal cells, which are located in the deepest layer of the epidermis. BCC typically develops on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, and back. Although BCC grows slowly and rarely metastasizes, it can cause significant local damage if not treated promptly.<br>BCC often appears as a pearly or waxy bump, a flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, or a sore that bleeds, oozes, or crusts over and does not heal. It is important to recognize the signs and seek medical attention for any suspicious lesions.</p>
