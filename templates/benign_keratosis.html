                    <li class="list-group-item">Regular Skin Examinations: Conduct regular self-examinations of your skin to monitor the appearance and growth of any new or existing lesions. While seborrheic keratoses are typically benign, it is important to differentiate them from potentially harmful skin conditions.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Sun Protection: Although benign keratosis-like lesions are not directly caused by sun exposure, protecting your skin from UV radiation can help prevent other types of skin cancer and minimize damage to the skin. Practice sun safety measures such as wearing sunscreen, seeking shade, and wearing protective clothing.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Consultation with a Dermatologist: If you notice any changes in the appearance or behavior of a skin lesion, or if you are unsure about a particular growth, consult a dermatologist for evaluation and diagnosis. Dermatologists can perform thorough skin examinations and may recommend biopsy or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Avoid Irritation: Refrain from picking, scratching, or attempting to remove benign keratosis-like lesions on your own, as this can lead to infection, scarring, or other complications. If a lesion becomes symptomatic or bothersome, seek advice from a healthcare professional for appropriate management.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Know Your Skin: Become familiar with the characteristics of benign keratosis-like lesions and other common skin growths to distinguish them from potentially harmful conditions. Educate yourself about the ABCDEs of melanoma and other warning signs of skin cancer to facilitate early detection and timely intervention.</li>
